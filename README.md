# Dopefolio

## Description

My motivation for the following project was building a successful portfolio website. The portfolio project helped me better understand CSS's functionalities and get more comfortable with HTML. I created this portfolio to represent the progress I have made so far in taking this course. The portfolio displays previous work in the Bootcamp and shows my improvement in the short time within the class. When building the portfolio, I had a significant problem getting the text to be above the images and centered within the page. To fix this, I have to change some of the HTML Semantic Elements to "div." For some reason, this would permanently fix the issue. I learned how to utilize CSS better while integrating it with HTML. One specific element I learned was how to make the header a photo.

The steps required to install my project as a repository are to open git bash or the IOS terminal. Then, proceed by cd'ing to the correct file directory and using git clone 'git@github.com:KyleCosaert/dopefolio.git'. For the next step, you open vs code by using the command 'code .' then you can examine and change the code as you would like.
